                <p>Roots Guidance Sound is a soundsystem based in London, dedicated to playing roots, dub and steppas music. Formed in 2011, they've been building up their profile, soundsystem and record collection to take the stage as the London Youthman sound. Working with artists and soundsystems such as Aba Shanti-I, Channel One, Iration Steppas and Young Warrior and playing sessions at countless nights throughout the country has taught them the skills needed to rock a dance in fine style.
